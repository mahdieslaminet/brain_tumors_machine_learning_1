In today's life and society, the correct diagnosis of brain tumors can save the lives of many people. In this article, we have helped to improve the diagnosis of these tumors by using 4 artificial neural networks.
You can use the following site to get the data.https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427
In this study, we have used Mattab programming language.
1)First, we return the existing matt numbers to the image so that we can use the MRA images

2)Then we increase the contrast of the images and normalize them.

3)The next step is to use neural networks to check them and then using svm, knn and softmax classifications, we check their accuracy in diagnosing three specific types of brain tumors.
