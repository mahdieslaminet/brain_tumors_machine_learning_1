# brain_tumors_machine_learning_1
In today's life and society, the correct diagnosis of brain tumors can save the lives of many people. In this article, we have contributed to improving the diagnosis of these tumors by using four artificial neural networks. You can use the following site to obtain the data: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427. In this study, we have used the MATLAB programming language.

1)First, we assign the existing MAT
numbers to the image so that we can use the MRI images.

2)Next, we enhance the contrast of the images and normalize them.

3)The subsequent step involves utilizing neural networks to check them. Following that, we use SVM, KNN, and Softmax classifications to assess their accuracy in diagnosing three specific types of brain tumors.
